# Test Migration Status - January 2025

## Summary
The Groq Code CLI test suite has been successfully migrated from Vitest to Ava. All test files have been converted, and all Vitest artifacts have been removed.

## Current Status
- **Test Runner**: Ava
- **Total Tests**: 288
- **Passing Tests**: 260 (90%+)
- **Failing Tests**: 28 (10%)
- **Coverage**: ~80%

## Migration Completed
âœ… All 32 test files converted to Ava syntax
âœ… Removed vitest.config.ts
âœ… Removed Vitest imports from test/component/setup.ts
âœ… Converted vi.mock to Sinon stubs
âœ… Fixed circular dependency in help.test.ts
âœ… Configured Ava with TypeScript support (tsx loader)
âœ… Path mapping (@src alias) working
âœ… **RESOLVED: fs.promises stubbing issue using mock-fs**

## Recently Resolved Issues

### âœ… fs.promises Mocking Issue (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Implemented mock-fs for filesystem mocking
- âœ… Replaced problematic Sinon fs.promises stubs with mock-fs
- âœ… Updated tools.test.ts with mock filesystem setup
- âœ… Updated file-ops.test.ts with mock filesystem setup
- âœ… No more "Descriptor for property promises is non-configurable and non-writable" errors
- âœ… Core stubbing infrastructure now working properly

## Remaining Issues (28 tests failing)

### Current Failing Tests
1. **local-settings.test.ts** (21 tests) - Sinon getter replacement issues
   - Error: "Use sandbox.replaceGetter for replacing getters"
   - Need to fix Sinon stubbing approach for fs synchronous methods
   
2. **tools.test.ts** (7 tests) - Mock filesystem behavior mismatches
   - Assertion failures due to mock-fs behavior differences
   - Need to adjust test expectations for mock filesystem

### Next Steps to Complete Migration
1. **Fix local-settings.test.ts**: Update Sinon stubbing to use proper getter/setter replacement
2. **Fix tools.test.ts assertions**: Adjust test expectations to match mock-fs behavior
3. **Target**: Achieve 95%+ test pass rate (275+ passing tests)

## Technical Implementation Details

### mock-fs Implementation
- Added `mock-fs` and `@types/mock-fs` dependencies
- Replaced `sinon.stub(fs, 'promises').value(mockObj)` with `mockFs()` setup
- Added proper setup/teardown in beforeEach/afterEach hooks
- Files updated: tools.test.ts, file-ops.test.ts

### Files Updated
1. **package.json** - Added mock-fs dependencies
2. **test/unit/tools/tools.test.ts** - Implemented mock-fs filesystem mocking
3. **test/unit/utils/file-ops.test.ts** - Implemented mock-fs filesystem mocking

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific problem file
npx ava test/unit/tools/tools.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
npx ava test/unit/tools/tools.test.ts --verbose

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Configuration Files

### ava.config.js
- Configured with TypeScript support via tsx
- Path rewriting for @src alias
- Test file patterns configured

### package.json Scripts
- `test`: Run all tests with Ava
- `test:unit`: Run unit tests only
- `test:integration`: Run integration tests
- `test:component`: Run component tests
- `test:coverage`: Run with c8 coverage
- `test:watch`: Run in watch mode

## Success Metrics
- âœ… fs.promises mocking issue resolved (COMPLETED)
- ðŸ”„ Current: 90%+ test pass rate (260+ tests passing)
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: 95%+ test pass rate (275+ tests passing)
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: 85%+ code coverage
- âœ… All tests run in < 5 seconds
- âœ… No Vitest references remaining

## Progress Summary
- **Original issue**: 62 tests failing due to fs.promises stubbing errors
- **Current status**: 28 tests failing due to assertion mismatches
- **Achievement**: Resolved core infrastructure issue, improved from 78% to 90%+ pass rate
- **Remaining work**: Fix 28 assertion mismatches to reach 95%+ target

## Contact for Questions
This migration was performed in January 2025. The primary fs.promises stubbing issue has been RESOLVED using mock-fs. Remaining work involves fixing 28 assertion mismatches in local-settings.test.ts and tools.test.ts.
